# ctrlX Data Layer Provider

## Introduction

The app demonstrates how a Data Layer connecion is established and a string and flatbuffers node are provided.

## Function Description

The app connects to the ctrlX Data Layer and provides a string and flatbuffers node .

If the Data Layer connection breaks the app will exit. After 10s it will be automatically restarted by snapd.

## Implementation Description

### Compile Flatbuffers Schema

This app uses a flatbuffer defined in the schema file sampleSchema.fbs. From this schema file we have to create a binary file which is registered on the ctrlX and a Python class to create and access the defined flatbuffer data. These tasks can be done with the command line tool flatc.

This tool is provided by this SDK under /bin/oss.flatbuffers/..insert OS version here../release/

Do following steps - OS version here is 'linux-gcc-x64':

* Create a binary flatbuffers file:

    ../../bin/oss.flatbuffers/linux-gcc-x64/release/flatc -o bfbs/ -b --schema sampleSchema.fbs

* Generate the Python code:

    ../../bin/oss.flatbuffers/linux-gcc-x64/release/flatc --python sampleSchema.fbs

The generated code is stored in sample/schema/InertialValue.py

### Modules

* The module __main.py__ manages the Data Layer connection and the creation of the Data Layer nodes.
* The module __app/my_provider_node.py__ contains the class MyProviderNode with the callback function needed by the Data Layer.
* The file __sampleSchema.fbs__ contains the schema for the flatbuffers data struct used by this app.
* The module __sample/schema/InertialValue.py__ is generated by flatc from sampleSchema.fbs. It is used to manage the flatbuffers data struct.
